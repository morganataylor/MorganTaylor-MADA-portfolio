## Introduction
This exercise focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis from the influenza data.


The raw data for this exercise comes from the following citation:
McKay, Brian et al. (2020), Virulence-mediated infectiousness and activity trade-offs and their impact on transmission potential of patients infected with influenza, Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.51c59zw4v.

The processed data was produced on the `Data Processing` tab.


Within this analysis, the main continuous outcome of interest is body temperature and the main categorical outcome of interest is nausea. For each symptom, we will do the following steps:

1. Produce and print some numerical output (e.g. table, summary statistics)
2. Create a histogram or density plot (continuous variables only)
3. Scatterplot, boxplot, or other similar plots against the main outcome of interest
4. Any other exploration steps that may be useful.

For each variable, the EDA steps will be labeled by the numbers listed above.

## Required Packages
The following R packages are required for this exercise:

* here: for path setting
* tidyverse: for all packages in the Tidyverse (ggplot2, dyplr, tidyr, readr, purr, tibble, stringr, forcats)
* summarytools: for overall dataframe summary
* ggplot2: for plotting data
* car: for creating QQ plots
* table1: for creating tables for summary statistics / other numerical outputs
* scales: for percent calculation
* margrittr: for sequential piping

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load the required packages for this script
library(here) #to set paths
library(summarytools) #to create overall dataframe summary
library(ggplot2) #to create figures
library(car) #to create QQ plots
library(table1) #to create tables for summary statistics / other numerical outputs
library(scales) #to calculate percents
library(dplyr) #for piping
library(magrittr) # for sequential piping

# formatting for script to avoid scientific notation output
options(scipen=999)

# globally set theme for ggplots
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

---

## Load Processed Data
Load the data created on the `Data Processing` page.
```{r}
# path to data
# note the use of the here() package and not absolute paths
data_location <- here::here("data","flu","processeddata.rds")

# load data using the "ReadRDS" function in base R.
processeddata <- base::readRDS(data_location)

# create a mirror dataset to avoid manipulating the cleaned dataset
EDAdata <- processeddata
```

---

## Data Overview
To better understand the processed data, let's use `summarytools` to visualize the dataframe.
```{r}
summarytools::dfSummary(EDAdata)
```
Looking at the data summary, there are multiple variables for the same symptom (e.g. category and presence). Additionally, several of the categorical variables have an uneven proportion distribution, and `BodyTemp` appears to have some skew as well.

The outcome variables of interest were specified as part of the MADA course, so what predictor varaibles may be relevant?

* The data is about influenza, so certainly symptoms commonly associated with influeza (e.g. runny nose, nasal congestion, chills / sweating, and myalgia).
* Since we are interested in nausea, we should also probably include nausea and vomiting (co-presentation).

## Main Continuous Outcome of Interest: Body Temperature
```{r}
# start with main continuous outcome of interest: body temperature
# (1) since it is continuous, we can calculate summary statistics with the base summary function
base::summary(EDAdata$BodyTemp)

# (2) create a density plot for body temperature
ggplot2::ggplot(data = EDAdata, aes(x = BodyTemp)) +
  geom_density()

# looking at the histogram and summary statistics, there appears to be a left skew from a normal distribution
# (3) create a boxplot to better visualize
# since body temperature is the main outcome of interest, no need to plot it against anything
ggplot2::ggplot(data = EDAdata, aes(y = BodyTemp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# there is clearly a skew in the data towards normal body temperature (98.6F)
# choosing to keep the points in the 101 - 103 F range as these are clinically reasonable values for influenza patients
# in other words, they are unlikely to be clinically  significant outliers

# it is still worth examining the normality assumption, especially since we are moving to linear model fitting next
# (4) create a QQ-plot for body temperature
car::qqPlot(EDAdata$BodyTemp)
# this clearly shows the body temperature data violates the normality assumption for linear models
```
Looking at the histogram and summary statistics, there appears to be a left skew from a normal distribution. The QQ plot further affirms a violation of the normality assumption. All of the values of body temperature are within clinically reasonable bounds for influenza (likely febrile) patients.

## Main Categorical Outcome of Interest: Nausea
```{r}
# now move onto main categorical outcome of interest: nausea
# before any analysis, create a label for nausea so outputs are more interpretable
EDAdata$Nausea <- base::factor(processeddata$Nausea, levels = c("No", "Yes"), labels = c("Nausea Absent", "Nausea Present"))

# (1) since it is categorical, we can only examine frequency and proportions of the variable
# this can be done with the summary tools package function "freq" and options to hide NAs (removed during processing)
summarytools::freq(EDAdata$Nausea, report.nas = FALSE)

# (2) skip as nausea is not a continuous variable

# (3) as this is a main outcome of interest, we can only create a bar plot in ggplot to illustrate distribution
# the two geom_text statements tell ggplot to calculate and display count and percentages at the top of each bar
ggplot2::ggplot(data = EDAdata, aes(x = Nausea)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = after_stat(count)),
    stat = 'count',
    nudge_x = -0.06,
    nudge_y = 0.2,
    vjust = -1) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = after_stat(scales::percent(prop, prefix = "(", suffix = "%)", accuracy = 0.1)), group = 1),
    stat = 'count',
    nudge_x = 0.06,
    nudge_y = 0.2,
    vjust = -1)
# it is almost a 2/3 vs 1/3 split for nausea in patients captured in this dataset
# there isn't much more descriptive work we can do here
```
The patients included in this dataset have an almost 2/3 vs 1/3 split for reports of nausea.

# (2) skip as Vomit is not a continuous variable

## Creating A "Table 1" For Categorical Outcome of Interest (Nausea)
Often the first table of a manuscript lists the predictors on each row with columns representing the outcome in question. The `table1` package works extremely well for categorical variables.
```{r}
# first, create the summary statistics within the Table1 package for predictor variables
# already created earlier, but placed here for reference
table1::label(EDAdata$RunnyNose) <- "Runny Nose"
table1::label(EDAdata$Pharyngitis) <- "Pharyngitis"
table1::label(EDAdata$NasalCongestion) <- "Nasal Congestion"
table1::label(EDAdata$CoughIntensity) <- "Cough Intensity"
table1::label(EDAdata$ChillsSweats) <- "Chills / Sweating"
table1::label(EDAdata$Myalgia) <- "Myalgia"
table1::label(EDAdata$Vomit) <- "Vomit"
table1::label(EDAdata$Diarrhea) <- "Diarrhea"

# now, load all into a table 1 where columns represent nausea categories
table1::table1(~ RunnyNose + Pharyngitis + NasalCongestion + CoughIntensity + ChillsSweats + Myalgia + Vomit + Diarrhea 
               | Nausea, data = EDAdata)

# in a real analysis, we could also use this table for our univariate analysis, so we could conduct a chi-square test
# to test for differences in each variable across the Nausea strata.
```
